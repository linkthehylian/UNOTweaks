# UNOTweaks

### Description
Tweaks for Ubisoft's "UNO".

### Features
- Skip intro videos
- Custom deck and card skins (by [ExiMichi](https://github.com/ExiMichi), instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/linkthehylian/UNOTweaks/wiki/UNO-Skins))
- Toggle to enable or disable V-Sync
- Set your preferred FPS when V-Sync is disabled

### Installation

- Drag and drop or copy and paste the `Assembly-CSharp.dll` to `Uno\UNO_Data\Managed`. ("**Replace the file in the destination**", if prompted)
- If you want to backup the original `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, make sure you do that before replacing it!
- You **must** own UNO on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/470220/UNO/) for these tweaks to work.

- I don't own "UNO", this is Ubisoft's game and it's their property. I've only included the classes I edited for this project and not the entire source code. You can use either of the following .NET disassemblers to make your own:
